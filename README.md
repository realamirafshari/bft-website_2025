## Brutal Forensic Tool

## Key Features
Modern responsive UI built with TailwindCSS and DaisyUI for consistent
components and fast development. Authentication and role-based access control
via NextAuth (support for OAuth providers and email sign-in). MongoDB as the
primary datastore for jobs, device records, logs, and user profiles. Job
management: create, assign, and track repair jobs with customer metadata and
device info. Repair tool modules (example modules — high level only): FRP status
checker and authorized workflow for FRP-related repair operations (no
step-by-step bypass instructions included). Screen lock / unlock management
interface for documented and authorized operations. Diagnostic log viewer and
file attachments. Audit logging: record all sensitive operations with user,
timestamp, and reason. Light / Dark themes with a11y considerations. Extendable
plugin/module system so new device manufacturers and repair procedures can be
added by developers. API-first design to allow integration with local shop
software and mobile apps.
